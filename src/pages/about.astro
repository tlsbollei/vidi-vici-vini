          About Me
        </h1>
        <p class="prose prose-neutral mb-8 dark:prose-invert">
          Hey, I'm <b>tlsbollei</b>. I currently work as a Red Teamer at
          <Link href="https://fortinet.com" external>Fortinet</Link>, and at the age of 16,
          I'm pursuing secondary education at
          <Link href="https://gymholl.edupage.org" external>Gymnázium Jána Hollého</Link>.
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-neutral mb-8 dark:prose-invert">
          As far as CTFs go, I represent my country, Slovakia, and consistently play with them as part of
          <Link href="https://ctftime.org/team/197247/" external>Slovak Cyber Team</Link>, where I love solving hardcore reverse engineering challenges, along with the occasional crypto. Professionally,
          I work as a Red Teamer, and I conduct persistent assessments on digital infrastructures,
          focusing on the Active Directory structure and the Windows environment. Simply said - we emulate adversaries. However, I also have extensive experience in Blue Teaming, with a lot of exposure to both proactive and reactive Incident Response, Digital Forensics and SOC analytics, along with Detection Engineering.
          This exposure to "the other side" has aided me immensely in developing highly evasive implants.
        </p>
        <p class="prose prose-neutral mb-8 dark:prose-invert">
          Outside of that, I develop custom malware loaders, deep-dive into Windows internals, and my main
          focus lies in enterprise EDR evasion, an area to which I contribute academically. More about me and my achievements, right
          <Link href="https://tlsbollei.vercel.app/about" external>here (soon = ( • . • ) = </Link>.
        </p>
         <p class="prose prose-neutral mb-8 dark:prose-invert">
          Outside of the world of cybersecurity, I love sleeping! As you might have already figured out, I'm a big fan of manga/light novels/manhwa, and you might see me losing my mind over Dota 2 and League of Legends.
          I play alot of strategy games, and a lot of chess.
